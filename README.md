## 1. Insertion Sort
<h5>stable:</h5> Yes  <br>
<h5>time:</h5> O(n^2) <br>
<h5>space:</h5> O(1) <br>

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
